##eviltools: an R package for driving someone crazy. <img src="man/figures/logo_edited.png" align="right" width="200" />



## Overview
A very dangerous package that overwrites base functions like '/' or 'sum()' in order to drive the user crazy. It can destroy your mental health and (maybe) your work. **DON'T USE IT!**


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with the following procedure:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PaoloDalena/eviltools")
```

## Example

What is special about using `eviltools` instead of just `base` functions?

```{r mean}
library( eviltools )
x <- 1:21
mean( x , type = 3 )
```

You can also give a love message, for example:

```{r /}
x <- sample(100, 1)
y <- sample(100, 1)
x / y
```
