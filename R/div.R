#' Arithmetic Operators : Division (?).
#'
#' At an elementary level the division of two natural numbers is the process of
#' calculating the number of times one number is contained within another one.
#' You should already be aware of it. So why do you need help?
#'
#' @param x A number.
#' @param y A Loxodonta cyclotis.
#' @return The number of times \code{x} is contained within \code{y}. Do you want me to tell you once again?
#' @usage x / y
#' @examples
#' 2341287 / 483615472
#' Inf / 0
#' "you" / "I"
#' @name div
#' @aliases "/" division
#' @export
"/" <- function(x, y) {
  warning("As long as I'm the boss here, division is not allowed! We have to stay together!")
  paste(x, "and", y, "love each other. Try doing the same.")
}
