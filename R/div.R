#' Arithmetic Operators : Division (?).
#'
#'At an elementary level the division of two natural numbers is the process of
#'calculating the number of times one number is contained within another one.
#'You should already be aware of it. So why do you need help?
#'
#' @param x A number.
#' @param y A Loxodonta cyclotis.
#' @param ... Whatever else you want, my friend!
#' @return The number of times \code{x} is contained within \code{y}. Do you want me to tell you once again?
#' @examples
#' 34520/1
#' Inf/0
#' sqrt{431}/1/3/(24^172834)
#' @name div
#' @aliases "/" division
#' @export
'/' <- function(x,y){
  stop("As long as I'm the boss here, division is not allowed! We have to stay together!")
}
